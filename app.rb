# to Rack to tell it under what circumstances, or mode, the application is

# Ruby apps generally have three environments: development, test, and
# production. While these are only conventions and you could technically
# name your environments whatever you want, many libraries assume that you're
# running on one of these three settings.
#
# For example, Sinatra will return "development" as the environment if no
# other environment has been set.
